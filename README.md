# Linear-Algebra-for-ML-and-Data-Science

## This course is part 1/3 of the Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization on Coursera by Luis Serrano

This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments for the Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science course on Coursera, taught by Luis Serrano. This course is designed to teach the fundamentals of linear algebra that are necessary for machine learning and data science.

### Course Overview
The course is divided into five weeks, each covering a different aspect of linear algebra:

* Week 1: Vectors and Matrices
* Week 2: Linear Transformations and Linear Equations
* Week 3: Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
* Week 4: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
* Week 5: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Each week includes video lectures, reading materials, and programming assignments. 

The programming assignments are implemented in Python using the NumPy library, and cover a range of topics such as matrix multiplication, solving systems of linear equations, computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and performing PCA.

### Getting Started
To use the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

* NumPy
* Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:
_pip install numpy matplotlib_
